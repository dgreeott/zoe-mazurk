                  I'm currently working as an undergraduate student at Coe
                  College. I'm double majoring in Political Science and Art. I
                  moved to Iowa from Boulder, Colorado where I've lived most of
                  my life.
                </h5>
                <h5>
                  My favorite mediums are painting with acrylic and watercolor
                  as well as sketching. I prefer two-dimensional work the most
                  but I have experimented with sculpture classes which I found
                  challenging but beneficial to my learning experience as an art
                  student.
