           <p>
            My name is ZoÃ« Mazurkiewicz and I'm currently working as 
            an undergraduate student at Coe College. I'm double majoring in 
            Political Science and Art. I moved to Iowa from Boulder, Colorado 
            where I've lived most of my life. 

            My favorite mediums are painting with acrylic and watercolor 
            as well as sketching. I prefer two-dimensional work the most but 
            I have experimented with sculpture classes which I found challenging 
            but beneficial to my learning experience as an art student. </p>
