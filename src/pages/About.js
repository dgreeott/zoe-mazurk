                My name is ZoÃ« Mazurkiewicz and I'm currently working as 
                an undergraduate student at Coe College. I'm double majoring in 
                Political Science and Art. I moved to Iowa from Boulder, Colorado 
                where I've lived most of my life.

                My favorite mediums are painting with acrylic and watercolor 
                as well as sketching. I prefer two-dimensional work the most but 
                I have experimented with sculpture classes which I found challenging 
                but beneficial to my learning experience as an art student.
