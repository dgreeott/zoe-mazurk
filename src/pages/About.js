                  My name is ZoÃ« Mazurkiewicz and I'm currently working as an
                  undergraduate student at Coe College. I'm double majoring in
                  Political Science and Art. I moved to Iowa from Boulder,
                  Colorado where I've lived most of my life.

                  My favorite mediums are painting with acrylic and watercolor
                  as well as sketching. I prefer two-dimensional work the most
                  but I have experimented with sculpture classes which I found
                  challenging but beneficial to my learning experience as an art
                  student.
